ClaimManager
============

Extends Grief Prevention, the popular Bukkit plugin, to allow users to manage their claims.

The original Grief Prevention plugin was designed purely for grief prevention! This mod allows server
admins (or anybody with the right permissions) to...

1 - Buy/Sell claims
2 - Rent claims (server admins can determine the real time period for renewels).

Flags can also be set on claims that allow...

1 - Entry/Exit messages
2 - Stop mobSpawning (Not neutral mobs)

More features will be added as people make requests!
